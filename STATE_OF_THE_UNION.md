# State of the Union: Protocol: Silent Night
**Date:** 2025-12-31
**Status:** Phase 3 (Content Scaling) in progress.

## 🎯 Current Mission
We are transforming a Christmas-themed cyberpunk roguelike into a high-performance, mobile-first experience with deep meta-progression.

## ✅ Accomplishments (Today)
- **Merged PR #43**: Optimized HUD re-renders using `useShallow`, significantly reducing CPU overhead during gameplay.
- **Fixed CI/Security**: Resolved critical CodeQL injection vulnerabilities in workflows and fixed TypeScript build errors.
- **Weapon Expansion**: 
  - Fixed ID mismatches in `workshop.json` so weapons can now be properly unlocked.
  - Added 5 new Weapon Evolutions to `weapons.json` (Holiday Supernova, Tesla Tinsel, Frosted Fortress, Cathedral Chimes, Ultimate Present).
  - Verified 10+ weapons are now defined and ready for visual implementation.
- **System Stability**: Restored `package.json` after a buggy sync from `control-center` overwrote it with a generic template.
- **Testing**: Maintained 100% pass rate on 393 unit and integration tests.

## 🚀 What's Next
1. **Visual variety for Bullets**: `Bullets.tsx` needs specific geometries/materials for the new weapons (Shotgun, Turret, Whip, etc.).
2. **PR #50 (Optimization)**: "Optimize R3F components" is pending merge. It eliminates per-frame re-renders for Bullets and Enemies.
3. **PR #49 (Security)**: "Sentinel: Add data integrity check" is pending merge. It adds checksums to save files.
4. **Weapon Selection UI**: Although we have `WeaponHUD` for gameplay switching, we could improve the pre-game selection in `StartScreen`.

## 🛠️ Infrastructure Note
- **`control-center`**: This is the organization's "brain" for CI/CD and AI workflows. It occasionally pushes "sync" PRs which can be buggy (e.g., overwriting `package.json`). I have manually corrected this once.
- **AI Automation**: The `Ecosystem` workflow is now live, providing `cascade` routing for AI assistance (`/jules`, `/cursor`, `@claude`).
