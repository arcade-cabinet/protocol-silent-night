# E2E Tests - Non-blocking workflow with auto-healing
#
# This workflow runs Playwright E2E tests separately from the main CI.
# It is designed to:
# - Not block PR merges (uses workflow_run trigger)
# - Capture screenshots and artifacts
# - Auto-heal failures with Claude
# - Post updates to PRs
#
# Based on recommended patterns from:
# - https://playwright.dev/docs/ci-intro
# - https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action/tree/main/examples

            ## 🔧 E2E Test Auto-Heal

            **PR:** #${{ needs.e2e.outputs.pr_number }}
            **Branch:** ${{ github.event.workflow_run.head_branch || github.ref_name }}
            **Test Run:** https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}

            ## Project: Protocol: Silent Night

            Commands:
            - Build: `pnpm build`
            - E2E tests: `pnpm test:e2e`
            - Single test: `pnpm exec playwright test <test-file>`

            ## Test Artifacts

            Check the `test-artifacts/` directory for:
            - playwright-report/index.html - HTML test report
            - test-results/ - Screenshots and traces of failed tests

            ## Instructions

            1. Analyze the test failures from playwright-report
            2. Check screenshots in test-results for visual clues
            3. Identify whether it's a test issue or app bug
            4. Make the fix (prefer fixing app code over test code)
            5. Run `pnpm test:e2e` to verify
            6. Commit and push the fix
            7. Update PR with explanation of the fix

            Focus on:
            - Selector stability (use data-testid attributes)
            - Timing issues (use proper waits, not arbitrary delays)
            - State management (ensure proper test isolation)
