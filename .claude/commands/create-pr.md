# Create Pull Request

Create a new branch, commit changes, and submit a pull request.

## Process

1. **Pre-flight Checks**
   ```bash
   pnpm run typecheck
   pnpm test
   pnpm run build
   ```

2. **Create Branch** (if needed)
   - Use descriptive name: `feat/description` or `fix/description`
   ```bash
   git checkout -b <branch-name>
   ```

3. **Analyze Changes**
   ```bash
   git diff
   git status
   ```

4. **Split into Logical Commits**
   - Each commit should focus on single concern
   - Related file changes stay together
   - Separate refactoring from features

5. **Push to Remote**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin <branch-name>
   ```

6. **Create PR**
   ```bash
   gh pr create --title "..." --body "..."
   ```
