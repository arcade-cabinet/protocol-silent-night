## [Unreleased]

### Post-batch polish (codex/production-polish → integration/production-polish)

- **Tests — save_manager coverage**: `test_register_level_reached_tracks_best_level` (verifies `maxi` monotonic guard + disk persistence) and `test_merge_dict_rejects_unknown_top_level_keys` (tampered save with injected root key is silently dropped) added to `test_save_manager.gd`
- **Tests — board_builder coverage**: New `test/unit/test_board_builder.gd` (5 tests) — foundation adds 6 nodes (outer field + arena surface + 4 border walls); drifts adds 1 node per drift entry; empty board adds nothing; outer ridge adds exactly 24 chunks (4 segments × 6 steps); ridge is seeded-deterministic
- **Security — save injection guard**: `_merge_dict` `top_level` allowlist blocks schema-unknown root keys from tampered save files while leaving nested gear slot keys unrestricted
- **Accessibility — coal button HIG**: Coal sidebar buttons `custom_minimum_size` raised from `40px` to `60×48px` (meets 44pt iOS HIG and 48dp Material minimum)
- **Accessibility — reduced_motion**: `particle_effects.gd` wired into `apply_reduced_motion` pipeline (`configure(reduced)` + `spawn_death_burst` gated); pause button shown/hidden correctly in `show_gameplay_ui`
- **Performance — spark pool**: `flair_animator.gd` pools `MeshInstance3D` sparks (cap 32) with `reparent(parent, false)` for cross-parent reuse; eliminates per-spark allocation on every player movement frame
- **Performance — shadow mesh dedup**: `enemy_director.gd` lazy-inits one `PlaneMesh` per type (enemy + boss); was allocating a new mesh per spawn (up to 49 allocations per wave)
- **Balance — XP curve cap**: `progression_manager.gd` caps `xp_needed` at 500; prevents `1.45^N` XP wall from stalling upgrade flow at late levels
- **Persistence — level tracking**: `save_manager.gd:register_level_reached` + `game_manager.gd` call site; `best_level` now persists across sessions alongside `best_wave`
- **Release — APK artifact**: `release.yml` changed from `--export-debug` to `--export-release` for production-optimized APK builds

### Integration audit — 8-specialist pass (integration/production-polish)

- **Balance — speed scaling**: `speed_mult` now superlinear via `pow(lf/10+1, 1.3)` — enemies outrun the player at level 20+ as intended ("death is the game")
- **Balance — boss XP**: Krampus-Prime `drop_xp` 0→25; killing the boss now meaningfully accelerates progression
- **Balance — upgrade cap**: `damage` and `fire_rate` stacks capped at 5 each (was uncapped — 1.25^∞ violated "pressure valve not godmode" intent)
- **Performance — particle materials**: `particle_effects.gd` now caches `StandardMaterial3D` by `(color, energy)` key; eliminates per-particle allocation (13 per death burst)
- **Performance — enemy cap**: `enemy_director.gd` guards `spawn_enemy` with `MAX_ENEMY_CAP=48` to bound mobile frame budget
- **Code — board ridge stub**: `board_builder.gd:build_outer_ridge` implemented (was bare `pass`) — ice-chunk protrusions along arena perimeter
- **Visual — preview camera**: `present_preview_viewport.gd` uses `look_at_from_position()` to avoid "not in tree" crash on menu load
- **Visual — victory screen**: "Cookies Earned: 0 C" trailing-C abbreviation removed
- **Tone — upgrade names**: `High Caliber`→`Powder-Keg Payload`, `Overclock CPU`→`Workshop Overdrive`, `Kinetic Boots`→`Sleigh-Runner Soles`, `Advanced Optics`→`Tinsel-Scope`
- **Tone — tag charms**: "Valid forever"/"With love"/"Dreams written" flavor replaced with menacing copy matching holidaypunk identity
- **CI — Android on PRs**: `build-android-debug` job added to `ci.yml` — APK built and uploaded on every pull request (was only on push to main)
- **CI — LOC check**: Glob changed from `scripts/*.gd` to `find scripts scenes -name "*.gd"` — recursive, covers all subdirs
- **CI — gdUnit4 exit code**: Removed `--continue` flag — non-zero exit now fails the step; e2e suite added to CI run
- **Tests — 243/243**: Fixed `test_enemy_bt.gd` `Callable(lambda,"call")` parse error (13 tests were silently skipped); added `.uid` files for 6 newly discovered scripts; `test_full_session_flow.gd` now runs via gdUnit4 (not `-s`)

### CI/Security Hardening (post-batch, codex/production-polish)

- **GitHub Actions SHA pinning**: All action refs pinned to full commit SHAs across ci/cd/release/release-please workflows (addresses SonarCloud hotspot S6720 — mutable version tags)
- **Job-level permissions**: Write permissions moved from workflow level to individual job level in all four workflows (SonarCloud quality gate fix)
- **gdUnit4 flag fix**: CI test command corrected to `--continue` (was `--continue-on-failure` which is unrecognized in v6.1.2; caused CI exit 100)
- **preload() hoisting**: All `preload()` calls inside function bodies hoisted to file-level `const` declarations across 8 scripts (main, game_manager, audio_manager, ui_manager, particle_effects, player_controller, main_helpers, audio_manager_ext) — eliminates per-call script re-parsing overhead
- **Stale PR cleanup**: Closed #146 (superseded by stack), #112 and npm dependabot PRs #130-#132/#135/#139 (referenced files no longer in repo)
- **Reviewer bug fixes** (post-CI batch, addressing PR #148-#152 review comments):
  - `flair_animator.gd`: duplicate shared material before mutating in `_tick_color_shift`; set `emission_enabled = true` before writing emission color; preserve fractional spark accumulator remainder; lazy-init shared SphereMesh+material per entry instead of per-spawn; guard tween callback with `is_instance_valid`; extract `SPARK_INTERVAL` const
  - `coal_sidebar_ui.gd`: fix "ROAL"/"LOAL" label bug → "R-COAL"/"L-COAL"; remove unused `tint` param from `_start_idle_pulse`
  - `audio_manager.gd`: clamp restored bus volumes to `[-60, 6]` dB matching `set_bus_volume` guard
  - `procedural_sfx.gd`: clamp `cutoff` to `[0, 1]` in `make_noise_burst` to prevent IIR coefficient inversion
  - `ui_widgets.gd`: clear threat indicator when stale boss node is freed instead of silently returning
  - `present_parts.gd`: fix wavy arm angle (`sign_x*75` same as default) → `sign_x*45`
  - `main.gd`: call `apply_reduced_motion` at `_ready` so `reduced_motion` preference is respected before first run
  - `screen_shake.gd`: fix "exponential" → "linear" in docstring; remove dead `MAX_ROTATION` constant
  - `gear_visualizer.gd`, `gear_flair_visualizer.gd`: fix docstrings to match implementation
  - `music_director.gd`, `threat_indicator.gd`, `audio_3d_pool.gd`, `pause_menu.gd`, `coal_activator.gd`: comment accuracy fixes
  - `test_market_preview.gd`: add name-label and button descendant assertions to formerly shallow test
  - Untrack `.remember/tmp/save-session.pid` (gitignore already covered it)

### Game-Completion Batch (PR #152)

- **Enemy AI — BT state machines**: Pure GDScript BT state machines (`enemy_bt_states.gd`, `boss_bt_helpers.gd`) with no external dependency. Grunt: wander (>12u) → chase → contact. Rusher: idle → burst-sprint (2.5× speed, 0.6s) → cooldown (0.9s) with telegraph. Tank: advance → prep_slam (0.5s telegraph) → slam (1.8× dmg, 1.5u radius) → stagger (0.8s). Krampus HSM: phase 1 circle-strafe at 10u orbit + fan shots (0.9s); phase 2 charge every 4s + ranged (1.2s); phase 3 charge every 2.5s + multi-shot (3 proj, ±10°, 0.8s) + 2 minions every 6s.
- **Arena zone tinting**: Radial GLSL shader blend in arena floor — snow (white/pale blue, inner 32%), ice (cyan gloss, 32–68%), asphalt (dark industrial, 68–88%), with edge darkening. Roughness and specular track zone transitions.
- **Present portrait viewport**: `SubViewport` 3D panel on select screen renders a rotating present preview (45°/s Y spin via `auto_rotate.gd`) on button hover. `present_preview_viewport.gd` handles headless no-op. Radar chart and viewport both update on hover.
- **Board object visuals**: Frozen Mailbox (upright 0.4×0.8×0.4 box + mouth slot + frost sphere); Gift Cache (low wide 1.0×0.35×1.0 + ribbon cross, two gold strips); Chimney Vent (0.45r cylinder + CPUParticles3D smoke emitter + ember glow). All three get billboard health bars (QuadMesh, unshaded, `BILLBOARD_ENABLED`); handler updates scale.x on damage.
- **Android export**: `export_presets.cfg` with arm64-v8a, landscape locked, min SDK 28 / target SDK 34. `project.godot` gets `window/handheld/orientation=0`. Touch input tests verify drag→move and dash zone on 390×844 viewport.
- **E2E full-flow**: `test_full_session_flow.gd` — 2 waves + wave_clear drain + win + bumble unlock + menu return, headless, <15s.
- **Dead code removal**: `classes.json` and `waves.json` deleted; `_class_defs` parameter removed from `spawn_player` + `refresh_start_screen`; `_spawn_legacy_player` removed; `wave_formula.gd` is sole wave content source.
- **Architecture docs**: `AUDIO_ARCHITECTURE.md` (146 lines), `PRESENT_SYSTEM.md` (164 lines), `HUD_WIDGETS.md` (219 lines), `SCRIPTS_REFERENCE.md` (158 lines).
- **Tests**: +45 unit/component tests (198→243), all passing. Zero LOC violations.
